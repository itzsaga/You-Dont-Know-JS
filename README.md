# You Don't Know JS TL;DR Series

The popular You Don't Know JS Series of books contains a TL;DR at the end of every chapter. I have distilled these down in an easy to read fashion similar to the original repo for others to enjoy. I **HIGHLY** suggest reading the full books for free at [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).
